Hi, I’m THE paintable pony‼™ 👋🖌️🐎

And this is my DOs ✅ and DON'Ts ❌

DO ✅

Grab a brush, grab some dye, and paint!

Position yourself such that the tip of the brush is touching the place you want painted and indicate you're done choosing, you may nod, shake your head, kiss, turn your head a few times, nom, the possibilities are endless!

DON'T ❌

1. Don't TELL me what to do.

When I do this, I'm in F2 mode - I have chat bubbles disabled. 

Assume the pony is deaf. I don't wanna see a "Make the whole thing pink!" in the chat log. Do it with the brush and let me decide what the actual edit is gonna be.

2. Don't COPY me in front of my eyes.

I can't believe this has to be said, but it's common courtesy to NOT copy people's ideas.

At least wait until I leave so we don't have to compete for people's attention and I don't have to watch you butcher the entire concept and get mad.

3. Don't COVER me.

Pretty obvious in my opinion, the whole concept relies on being able to access any part you want painted, so please don't hinder on that that ability.

4. Don't CROWD me.

Take your turns. I can't do anything if you're all over me and I can't see who's trying to do what.

5. Don't try to paint what's already painted or make more than 3 edits.

I don't belong to you. Everyone has to have an equal opportunity to play with the concept. If you try to undo what someone did or take over everything that's available it takes that opportunity away, so play nice.
